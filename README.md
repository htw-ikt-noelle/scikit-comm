# Simulation toolbox for communication systems

This repository contains a collection of DSP routines and algorithms to perform numerical simulations on simple communication systems. Its functionality is divided into transmitter, link, and receiver subsystems and - at its current state - contains very limited functionalities.

This project was initially started by [Lutz Molle](https://www.htw-berlin.de/hochschule/personen/person/?eid=12017) and [Markus NÃ¶lle](https://www.htw-berlin.de/hochschule/personen/person/?eid=9586) at the [University of Applied Sciences (HTW), Berlin](https://www.htw-berlin.de/).
