Documentation of the comm DSP package
=====================================

This package is written in Python and is intended to grow into a simulation toolbox for communication systems. 

It contains a collection of DSP routines and algorithms to perform numerical simulations on simple communication systems. Its functionality is divided into transmitter, link, and receiver subsystems and - at its current state - contains very limited functionalities.

This project was initially started by Lutz Molle_ and Markus Nölle_ at the University of Applied Sciences ( HTW_ ), Berlin
